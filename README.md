# Pomelo

Pomelo is a Nintendo Switch Emulator based off of Sudachi for iOS devices.

# Piracy

WE DO NOT CONDONE OR SUPPORT PIRACY AT ALL. If you want to use Pomelo you will be required to dump the decryption keys, firmware and roms from a legally owned real Nintendo Switch system (not your friends or your cousins, nothing, **Your** own legally owned Switch).

# Info and FAQ

### NOTE: Some entitlements Pomelo depends on require a PAID Apple Developer Account. Your mileage with a free account or Trollstore might be limited. 

Pomelo is based on the Folium x Sudachi 1.1.4 code which was orginally sourced from the now defunct Yuzu emulator.

## iOS

1. This needs a Paid Apple developer account or you can build it with Xcode (guide comming soon)
2. you need JIT if your on iOS 17+ you can use [SideJITServer](https://github.com/nythepegasus/SideJITServer) if your on iOS 16.7+ then you can just use SideStore or Jitterbug


# Setup Guide

## Paid Dev Account

1. Sideload it normally (Through SideStore, AltStore or any Apple ID Sideloader)

2. Go to https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/identifiers

3. Find Pomelo and then enable these entitlements
